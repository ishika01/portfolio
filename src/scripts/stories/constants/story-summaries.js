However, as well as Component Based has become a so popular concept, I still see a lot of developers understanding components in a surprisingly weird way.",

Loosely coupling drives your code to smaller responsibilities and, consequently, granular objects which bring us fast understanding and easy maintenance. Sometimes, one of the strategies which can aid you to achieve this is to use events to make those granular objects communicate each other without necessarily know each other.",
