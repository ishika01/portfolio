      description: "Every developer knows the importance of keeping the code as much decoupled as possible. Loosely coupling drives your code to smaller responsibilities and, consequently, granular objects which bring us fast understanding and easy maintenance. Sometimes, one of the strategies which can aid you to achieve this is to use events to make those granular objects communicate each other without necessarily know each other.",
