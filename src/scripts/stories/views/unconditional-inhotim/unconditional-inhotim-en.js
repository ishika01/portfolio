          We all can recognize beauty in the immediate moment we stand before it.
          That was the certainty that I had the day I visited the world's
          largest open-air contemporary art museum. It's a garden that could be
          called paradise. Inhotim.

          Cosmococa</RExternalLink> gallery, you lie in bed, rest in the hammock,
          dive in the pool. The five <em>quasi-cinemas</em> - a concept created
          by <RExternalLink href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9lio_Oiticica">
          Hélio Oiticica</RExternalLink> - invade your senses as you invade them.

          Those are three out <RExternalLink href="https://www.inhotim.org.br/uploads/documents-downloads/mapa_visite_inhotim_final.pdf">
          more than twenty art galleries</RExternalLink> present in the garden.
          The space between each one of them is filled with extraordinary <RExternalLink href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3c/e5/0f/3ce50fc71a3f82942a71b577b3bd0d3a.jpg">
          Brazilian nature</RExternalLink>. The nature that we hear so much
          throughout our lives, but at thirty-two years, I still had no idea of
          what it really meant. Inhotim is a big garden, not in size only. It is
          also a giant in meaning and beauty.

        <h2>
          No explanation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Years later, I talk to colleagues in a city bar. They're all
          programmers. Everyone spends the day reading logical conditions. The
          work of everyone consists of explaining to a machine, through a
          programming language, what it should do.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the conversation, my compliments to Inhotim are inevitable. The
          curiosity of my colleagues comes out, and one of them turns to the
          mobile phone to do a quick search. He asks me what's the point of
          suspending a red cube as he shows me the work <RExternalLink href="https://www.itinerariodeviagem.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/INHOTIM-90.jpg">
          Red</RExternalLink> by Tsuruko Yamazaki's on his cell phone. It was
          uncomfortable for him to see that something didn't necessarily have an
          answer. That something was not explainable. That something had no logic.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Lots of opportunities
        </h2>
        <p>
          My colleague's question represents the perception of lots of people.
          We live in a society that is excessively dependent on logic. The logic
          is the base of concrete and highway, fuel and car, and latitude and
          longitude. Logic is everywhere. Without logic, we lose our coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I answered to my colleague that art, before anything else, is
          always an opportunity. The opportunity, at least for a few moments,
          to free ourselves from the explanations. To imagine everything that
          logic advises us against. To not understand or reason. The opportunity
          not to submit ourselves to any logical conditions. The opportunity to
          be, like Inhotim, unconditional.
